Top performers have a very different level of consistency game-to-game than the typical player â€“ p-value of 3.21e-28
Top performers are far less consistent with their scoring game-to-game than players across the league
Typical top performer std for points / game = 9.0 vs. 5.5 for the league as a whole
However, the linear regression shows that the majority of top performers are more consistent than expected based on the league-wide performance (The r-value is: 0.81)
Notable top performers include KD & LeBron, while TMac & James Harden are among the least consistent
